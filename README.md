# soobshestvo_2.0

Platform for communication in little society like a settlement or many flat house.

The problem:

It is almoust impossible to solve any problem on a global meeting for 200 people. Those who shout louder are the right ones.
We are crating a platform for making decision making more meritocratic.

So we devide the decision process into two parts:

1. Announcing the problem and collecting the variants of solving.
2. Voting for the way we want to solve it.

All the voting variants and the way each person votes are locked in blockchain.

The persons vote weight changes from its behaviour:

Weight gets bigger when person:
* suggest a problem
* suggest a variant of solving it
* vote in every voting
* pay more then a minimal price for solving the problem
* another person delegates you to vote for him

Weight gets lover when person:
* miss the voting
* don't pay the minimal price for solving

How we came up with the idea:

Last two years I live and work in my parents country house. There are some problems with electricity and the road that gets worther and worther. So I tried to do something about it on a global meetig: wrote a text with my suggestions and gave it to everyone on the meeting, but it made no sence. Even if I managed to convince everybody, there was only about a forth part of total members of community, so I should call/e-mail to another 150 persons and convince them. I understood that it is possible to make it ones ot twice, but it is not the read desicion making system. So I read alot about how people solve it abroad, spoke with experts from housebuilding companies and formed the idea we are realising now.


How is it innovative?

The innovation is in deviding the process of decision making. I read about it in the book about inventions.


During the first part the group of inventors suggests any decision for the problem that came to their minds, without criticising or thinking in detail if it will work really good. So the real creative process is not disturbed by any "this will not work!" and so on.


The second part is about to dicuss the pros and cons of every decision and the final voting for the way we gonna solve this issue.


Also all the voting results and comments would be locked in the blockchain so noone can cheat about it.




What tools/platforms do we use.

nodejs + web3, mist, metamask


What was the biggest obstacle that our team overcame?

It is our fist project with blockchain, we had no experience in js.
So we understood briefly about blockchain, choose the platform and the way we gonna realise it.
