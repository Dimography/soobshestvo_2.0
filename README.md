# soobshestvo_2.0

Platform for communication in little society like a settlement or many flat house.

The problem:

It is almoust impossible to solve any problem on a global meeting for 200 people. Those who shout louder are the right ones.
We are crating a platform for making decision making more meritocratic.

So we devide the decision process into two parts:

1. Announcing the problem and collecting the variants of solving.
2. Voting for the way we want to solve it.

All the voting variants and the way each person votes are locked in blockchain.

The persons vote weight changes from its behaviour:

Weight gets bigger when person:
* suggest a problem
* suggest a variant of solving it
* vote in every voting
* pay more then a minimal price for solving the problem
* another person delegates you to vote for him

Weight gets lover when person:
* miss the voting
* don't pay the minimal price for solving
